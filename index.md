## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatar.png">

I am a third-year undergraduate student at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jianhua Tang](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/wusie_en/2020/0425/c25923a490121/page.htm). My research goal is to empower interactive AI systems with capabilities beyond the human level to assist humans effectively in real-world scenarios in sustainable and responsible ways. To achieve this goal, my recent research has been centered on the domains of **natural language processing** and **machine learning**. Currently, I am working as a research intern with Prof. [Yiren Fung](https://yrf1.github.io/), focusing on language models self-correction reasoning. I am also collaborating with Prof. [Jiaxin Huang](https://teapot123.github.io/) this summer.
